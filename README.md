#  "Analyzing achievable stiffness control bounds of robotic hands with coupled finger joints,"

This repository contains Matlab example for article by P. Rao, G. C. Thomas, L. Sentis and A. D. Deshpande, "Analyzing achievable stiffness control bounds of robotic hands with coupled finger joints," 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Singapore, 2017, pp. 3447-3452, doi: 10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989393.

Three exaples are discussed 

First, spring mass damper with series and parallel compliance [SMD  Simulation.m]

Second, Single joint R manipulator case [ R_simulation.m]

Third, RR Series chain manipulator with series complaince [ RR_simulation.m]
